  I got assigned to Doctor Vernel's team. Night shift, starting at 2100 hours. First patient arrived at 0132, with a mild concussion after falling out of bed, the ship had been rattling. Treatment was a dermal regenerator and 3 ccs of Hydrocortilene. Rest of shift proceeded calmly, no further incidents were noted. Doctor Vernel gave an introduction to the sick bay, but it does not diverge from standard Starfleet layouting. The sick bay is a little old, but fully capable of providing treatment.

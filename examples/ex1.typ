= Lieutenant's log, Stardate 42419.3

I got assigned to Doctor Vernel's team. Night shift, starting at 2100 hours. First patient arrived at 0132, with a mild concussion after falling out of bed, the ship had been rattling. Treatment was a dermal regenerator and 3 ccs of Hydrocortilene. Rest of shift proceeded calmly, no further incidents were noted. Doctor Vernel gave an introduction to the sick bay, but it does not diverge from standard Starfleet layouting. The sick bay is a little old, but fully capable of providing treatment.

No incidents were noted today, but the ship got hit by an asteroid at 0326 hours, causing a four point three microsecond outage of the tertiary pathogen detection system. Subsequently, it got disabled to avoid any further alarms in sickbay. I am tasked with filing a report to Starfleet and have officially protested the shutdown of vital ship systems.

Doctor Vernel has requested a full physical of the crew. First results are rolling in from the second shift. Third shift is tasked with analysing the results.

Lieutenant Fosher has a divergence in blood sugar density. I propose further observation. The rest of the crew is in acceptable health.

A case of mild food poisoning reported from the Beta shift mess hall. Three crew members presented with nausea and abdominal discomfort. Cultures confirmed a minor contaminant in the replicated protein matrix — traced to a faulty calibration in replicator 7B. Maintenance has been notified. All affected are recovering without complication.

Doctor Vernel instructed that all food synthesizers run a 24-hour decontamination cycle. Operations was not pleased, but safety takes precedence.

I was informed by Doctor Vernel that Bolia-Betazoids have divergent blood sugar levels. No further observation is required.

We have further analysed the crews health. Ensign Isago has reported inability to sit for prolonged times, ever since her collar bone was fractured on an away mission. My proposition is a transdermal regeneration cycle to heal the underlying bone.

There are no incidents noted.

Chief Engineer reported minor plasma burns following a conduit rupture on Deck 14. Treated with dermaline gel and tissue regenerator. She insisted on returning to duty within the hour — I logged the refusal of full rest per protocol.

Shipwide stress levels seem elevated since the asteroid impact. Two crew members have reported recurring headaches; Doctor Vernel suspects elevated EM interference in the crew quarters.

Doctor Vernel initiated crew physical evaluations for the command staff. Captain reports minor insomnia, likely stress-related. I suggested a mild sedative regimen, which was declined. "Captains don't sleep; they drift," she said.

Otherwise, medical operations are nominal. Supplies at 84% — requisition placed for replacement dermal coils.

We received a distress signal from a nearby freighter. No casualties, but several of their crew were suffering from severe dehydration. Sickbay treated seven individuals. Their gratitude was notable — they left us a crate of Antarean nectar in thanks. Doctor Vernel has locked it in storage until toxicity tests are complete.

A power fluctuation caused the stasis chamber to fail mid-cycle. Patient was unharmed, but the monitoring equipment registered false cardiac arrest. Three nurses and I nearly broke the emergency restraints pulling the chamber open. The system has been re-inspected and deemed safe.

We all agreed to a coffee break afterward.

Doctor Vernel has implemented new reporting standards. I am to record subjective crew wellbeing metrics twice per shift. Frankly, the crew seems tired of being asked how they feel. I note increased irritability, particularly among engineering.

Two cases of mild back strain treated. Otherwise uneventful.

Ensign Jora presented with dermal irritation after exposure to unidentified spores from an away mission. Symptom onset was rapid but non-lethal. Containment was declared within 12 minutes. Biofilters have been recalibrated.

Doctor Vernel praised response time — a rare occurrence.

Ship entered a dense nebula at 0410 hours. Sensor interference triggered multiple false pathogen alarms across decks 3-9. Sickbay operated under yellow alert for six hours.

No genuine infections detected. The crew, however, remains uneasy — even simulated biohazards put everyone on edge.

Routine medical drills executed successfully. Response time averaged 13.7 seconds above Starfleet standard, primarily due to outdated biobed interfaces. Doctor Vernel insists on software updates "when we're not in the middle of an asteroid field."

One case of minor finger laceration. Healed.

Quiet shift. Ship operations nominal. I used the downtime to recalibrate the tricorder network. Doctor Vernel called me "overly precise." I take that as a compliment.

One medtech noted the new readings are now 0.04% more consistent. Worth it.

= Lieutenant's log, Stardate 42437.9

The captain authorized partial shutdown of auxiliary systems to conserve power through the nebula. Sickbay lighting was reduced by twenty percent — Doctor Vernel calls it "ambience." I call it impractical.

No medical cases. Crew morale steady.
